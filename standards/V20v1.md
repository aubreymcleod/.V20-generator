# .V20 standard ver. 1
The `.v20 version 1` files are broken up into 2 parts: a Header and a Body. 
  
The Header defines critical information about the ROM (e.g. what area of memory the program needs to be loaded into), while the Body defines the raw data contained within the ROM. 
  
### Header (`64 bytes`)
The header is made up of the following ordered components (descriptions of various components are tracked bellow):

|component     |size       |
|--------------|-----------|
|signature     |`7 bytes`  |
|version #     |`1 byte`   |
|ROM name      |`32 bytes` |
|Auto-Exec     |`10 bytes` |
|Memory map    |`1 byte`   |
|Video flags   |`1 byte`   |
|Reserved space|`12 bytes` |
|              |           |
|Total Size:   |`64 bytes` |

#### Signature (`7 bytes`)
Our headerblock begins with a `7 byte` file signature to help internally validate the ROM file format. This signature is ASCII-encoded plaintest (`VIC-20v`)

#### Version Number (`1 byte`)
The version number is `1 byte` long, and is an unsigned byte. This is version 1, so accordingly the value is set to `0x01`; we can use this byte to identify file structure.

#### ROM Name (`32 bytes`)
The ROM Name is `32 bytes` long, ASCII-encoded byte string that holds the name of the ROM. This could be useful for identifying cartridges even without the correct file name; remaining white space is zeroed.

E.g. "Adventure #2: Pirate Cove" would be encoded as:
```
41 64 76 65 6e 74 75 72
65 20 23 32 3a 20 50 69
72 61 74 65 20 43 6f 76
65 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

#### Auto-Exec (`10 bytes`)
`10 bytes` are allocated for an auto-exec command (ASCII encoded). The first `9 bytes` are dedicated to the command while the last `1 byte` is dedicated to the enter key (`0x0A`). The command itself is tailed by the end-line character, and any remaining space is zeroed (if there is no command given, there will be no new line character). This functionality would be useful for games like Scott Adam's adventure games. Commands like `SYS 32592` would be encoded as:

```
53 59 53 20 33 32 35 39
32 0A
```

#### Memory Map (`1 byte`)
 
`1 byte` is allocated to define which `4kb` blocks are present in the body.

`8kb` ROMs are typically loaded into locations `$2000`,`$4000`,`$6000`, and `$A000` (location `$B000` can only hold a `4kb` ROM); `4kb` ROMs can be loaded at any of the given addresses. Accordingly, this format treats contiguous `8kb` ROMs as two `4kb` ROMs; increasing our addressable regions to `$3000`, `$5000`, and `$7000`.

With 8 possible regions to fill, we can encode the active banks using a single `byte`. 

This byte has the following bitwise flags:
| bit | memory address |
|-----|----------------|
| `0` | `$2000-$2FFF`  |
| `1` | `$3000-$3FFF`  |
| `2` | `$4000-$4FFF`  |
| `3` | `$5000-$5FFF`  |
| `4` | `$6000-$6FFF`  |
| `5` | `$7000-$7FFF`  |
| `6` | `$A000-$AFFF`  |
| `7` | `$B000-$BFFF`  |

These flags correspond to sequential `4kb` blocks in the body. E.g. "Pirate's Cove" takes up `16kb` and is loaded in at address `$4000`, while spanning `$4000-$7FFF`. The bank representation would then be,
`00111100` or more generally `3C`.

#### Video Flags (`1 byte`)

The video flag is `1 byte` which is used to encode various video options, currently only one flag is used, but the remaining 7 bits are reserved for future versions.

| bit | function               |
|-----|------------------------|
| `0` | `NTSC(0)/PAL(1) sync`  |
| `1` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE`  |
| `2` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE`  |
| `3` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE`  |
| `4` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE`  |
| `5` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE`  |
| `6` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE`  |
| `7` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE`  |

#### Reserved Space (`12 bytes`)

`12 bytes` are allocated for future use.
  
  
  
Under this schema our hypothetical copy of "Adventure #2: Pirate Cove" would have a header block like so:
```
56 49 43 2d 32 30 76 01
41 64 76 65 6e 74 75 72
65 20 23 32 3a 20 50 69
72 61 74 65 20 43 6f 76
65 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00
53 59 53 20 33 32 35 39
32 0A 3C 01 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

### Body (`4kb - 32kb`)
The body is made up of sequential `4kb` blocks, where blocks are loaded to  `$2000`, `$3000`, `$4000`, `$5000`, `$6000`, `$7000`, `$A000`, and `$B000`. Here, blocks are arranged from lowest destination address to highest, and the header defines which blocks are present in a given ROM.
