#.V20 standard ver. 1
The `.v20` file is broken up into 2 parts: a Header and a Body. 
  
The Header defines critical information about the ROM (e.g. what area of memory the program needs to be loaded into). 
  
The Body defines the raw data contained within ROM.
  
###Header (`64 bytes`)
The Header begins with an `8 byte` formatting definition, where the leading `7 bytes` are ASCII-encoded plaintext (`VIC-20v`) followed by an unsigned `1 byte` version number. This specification allows us to both identify our filetype internally and determine how we should process the file according to version number.
The formatting definition should be encoded as follows:
```
56 49 43 2d 32 30 76 01
```

Another `32 bytes` are then allocated to the ROM's name (ASCII encoded); such that any remaining white space is zeroed.
For instance, "Adventure #2: Pirate Cove" would be encoded as:
```
41 64 76 65 6e 74 75 72
65 20 23 32 3a 20 50 69
72 61 74 65 20 43 6f 76
65 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00
```
  
`22 bytes` are then allocated for an auto-exec command (ASCII encoded), useful for odd cartridges like the Scott Adam's adventures. Commands like `SYS 32592` would be encoded as:
```
53 59 53 20 33 32 35 39
32 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00
```

Following this, `1 byte` is allocated to define which `4kb` blocks are present in the body.
  
It is important to note that `8kb` ROMs are typically loaded into locations `$2000`,`$4000`,`$6000`, and `$A000` (location `$B000` can only hold a `4kb` ROM). That being said, `4kb` ROM chips can be loaded at any of the given addresses. Accordingly, this format treats contiguous `8kb` ROMs as two `4kb` ROMs; increasing our addressable regions to `$3000`, `$5000`, and `$7000`.
With 8 possible regions to fill, we can encode the active banks using a single `byte`. 

This byte has the following bitwise flags:

| bit | memory address |
|-----|----------------|
| `0` | `$2000`        |
| `1` | `$3000`        |
| `2` | `$4000`        |
| `3` | `$5000`        |
| `4` | `$6000`        |
| `5` | `$7000`        |
| `6` | `$A000`        |
| `7` | `$B000`        |

These flags correspond to sequential `4kb` blocks in the body. E.g. "Pirate's Cove" takes up `16kb` and is loaded in at address `$4000`, while spanning `$4000-$7FFF`. The bank representation would then be,
`00111100` or more generally `3C`.

The header section contains one more `byte` which is used to encode various properties of the ROM:

| bit | function               |
|-----|------------------------|
| `0` | `NTSC(0)/PAL(1) sync`    |
| `1` | `IEEE488 disable(0)/enable(1)` |
| `2` | `SidCart @ $9800 disable(0)/enable(1)` |
| `3` | `SidCart @ $9C00 disable(0)/enable(1)` |
| `4` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE` |
| `5` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE` |
| `6` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE` |
| `7` | `HELD FOR FUTURE USE` |

If our example copy of "Pirate Cove" is exclusively the PAL revision, and relies on very specific timings, then its settings byte would be encoded as `01`.

In review, the Header block is `64 bytes` long, and is made up of:

| component | size |
|-----------|------|
| formatting defintion | `(8 bytes)` |
| ROM's title | `(32 bytes)` |
| auto-exec | `(22 bytes)` |
| memory map | `(1 byte)`  |
| option flags | `(1 byte)` |

Under this schema our hypothetical copy of "Adventure #2: Pirate Cove" would have a header block like so:
```
56 49 43 2d 32 30 76 01
41 64 76 65 6e 74 75 72
65 20 23 32 3a 20 50 69
72 61 74 65 20 43 6f 76
65 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00
53 59 53 20 33 32 35 39
32 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 01
```

###Body (`4kb - 32kb`)
The body is made up of sequential `4kb` blocks, where blocks are loaded to  `$2000`, `$3000`, `$4000`, `$5000`, `$6000`, `$7000`, `$A000`, and `$B000`. Here, blocks are arranged from lowest destination address to highest, and the header defines which blocks are present in a given ROM.
